# NDList
Provides a generic, strongly typed multidimensional list. These lists allow slicing and indexing, and broadcasting of functions across them.

## Notes
This is a work-in-progress. There are known issues with the indices which are in the process of being solved. The failing unit tests highlight many of these issues.
